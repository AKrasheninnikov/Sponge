Sponge (beta)
======

#####Sponge SharePoint Configuration &amp; Logging Framework.

The Idea behind Sponge is pretty simple - A consistant, centralized and easy to configurable Configuration and
Logging component based on top of SharePoint. Every developer has asked him/her-self the same questions:

- Where should i put the configuration of my application?
- Where should i log my exceptions to?

Sponge tries to make these tasks very simple and straight forward. See the [Wiki](../../wiki/Home)  for more information.
